	</div>

	<div id="body">
		<h4>for loop</h4>
		<p>
		For loops repeat a section a fixed number of times since it has a counter variable 
		that determines when the loop should begin and end. For loops have 3 parts to 
		them: the initialization section, the conditional section, and the change section. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Use case: Counting every number from 0 to 100.
		</p>
	
		<h4>while loop</h4>
		<p>
		Simpler than for loops because all they have is 1 part, a conditional test in them 
		that accompanies the while statement. It tests the condition at the beginning of 
		the loop before any statements in the loop get read.</p>
		<p>
		Use case: Creating a videogame where the program needs to read how many lives a 
		character has and determining whether or not the user can continue playing. </p>
	
		<h4>do while loop</h4>
		<p>
		Very similar to while loops except the conditional test comes after the loop code. 
		Therefore, the loop is always ran at least once. For this reason, the code inside 
		the loop will always be output at least once, even if it’s false, since the 
		condition doesn’t get read until after anyways. </p>
	
		<h4>In Conclusion</h4>
		<p>
		While these loops can be used interchangeably in certain scenarios, their are 
		multiple use cases where a specific one is optimal. Identify the objective you're 
		coding your program for and choose your loops accordingly. </p>
