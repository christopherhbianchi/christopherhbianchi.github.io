		Switch and if/else perform similar functions however the switch is usually a much 
		more concise and efficient way to run multiple if/else statements. However, each 
		has unique advantages and disadvantages, and is optimal in different situations.
		</p>
	
		<h4>if/else</h4>
		<p>
		We use if/else statements if we want our code to perform an action if the 
		condition is true and if the condition is false.
		<br>
		<br>Example using if/else:
		<br>if (answer == correctAnswer) {
		<br>	score += 10;
		<br>	System.out.println(“That’s right. You get 10 points.”);
		<br>} else  {
		<br>	score -=5;
		<br>	System.out.println(“Sorry, that’s wrong. You lose 5 points.”); 
		<br>}
		<br>
		<br>When to use if/else:
				<ul>Simple comparisons</ul>
				<ul>If there aren't a lot of compares for a condition in your program</ul>
		</p>
	
	
	
		<h4>switch</h4>
		<p>
		In a switch statement the first line specifies the variable that is being tested. 
		We then form our block of code using the curly brackets { }, with multiple cases. 
		Then each case line checks the test variable in the switch statement against a 
		specific value. Then when one of these values being checked in the case statement 
		matches the variable being tested, the code then continues to run until it reaches 
		a “break” statement, or it get’s to a default statement and then reaches the 
		“break” statement. The switch statement works faster than if/else.
		<br>
		<br>Example using switch:
		<br>switch (grade) {
			<br>case = ‘A’;
			<br>System.out.println(“You got an A! Awesome!”);
			<br>break;
			<br>case = ‘B’;
			<br>System.out.println (“You got a B! Beautiful!”);
			<br>Default:
			<br>System.out.println (“You got an F. You’ll do well in Congress!”);
		<br>}
		<br>
		<br>When to use switch:
			<ul>Complex comparisons</ul>
			<ul>If there's a lot of compares for a condition in your program</ul>
		</p>
	
	
	
		<h4>In Conclusion</h4>
		<p>
		Switch and if/else perform similar functions however the switch is usually a much 
		more concise and efficient way to run multiple if/else statements. However, each 
		has unique advantages and disadvantages, and is optimal in different situations. 
		It is up to the programmer to decide which is more appropriate for the program’s 
		needs. </p>
