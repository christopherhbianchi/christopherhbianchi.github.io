	<div id="body">
		<p>
		Like most programming languages, Java consists of a small core with lots of 
		optional libraries that can be included if we choose so.
		<br>
		<br>java.util.Scanner is a library that contains functionality that allows us to 
		get information into our program from the keyboard or other places like files on 
		the computer or from the internet. 
		<br>
		<br>The notation works as follows. The Scanner object is a predefined class for 
		taking inputs from a user. The Scanner object exists within the util folder, which 
		is short for “utility” which contains utility classes. The util folder exists 
		within the java folder, and the java folder itself consists of lots of optional 
		libraries that we can import or call upon to improve the functionality of our java 
		programs. Such as the option of allowing user input when we import the Scanner 
		object.
		<br>
		<br>When you import that library, you are importing tools that allow your program 
		to get info from the keyboard, and other places. Throughout much of the JTHW 
		exercises, importing that library allowed users to interact with the program by 
		typing in inputs, which ultimately allowed for things such as the program being 
		able to store user inputs in variables and having the program react different ways 
		depending on user inputs.
