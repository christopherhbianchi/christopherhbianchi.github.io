		What is the difference between parameters and arguments when it comes to methods? 
		Many in the community use each of the terms interchangeably. However, there is a 
		distinct difference. A parameter is a variable in a method’s definition. An 
		argument is the actual value(s) or references that are assigned to the parameter 
		variables at runtime. For example, a function can be defined with a parameter such 
		as needing an int variable. However, when the function is called, the value that 
		you input into the parentheses next to the function would be the argument.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		That being said, Parameters are technically used when creating a method 
		definition. A parameter is a variable in a method definition. Arguments are used 
		when a method is called in a program since they’re the actual values of the 
		variable that gets passed to the function.
		</p>

		Parameters can be thought of what type of input needs to go into the 
		method/function in order for it to execute and process. While arguments can be 
		thought of as the values that you input into the function to be processed that 
		satisfy the parameter’s requirements.
