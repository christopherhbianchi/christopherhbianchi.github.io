		=, ==, and .equals() look similar in English, however they each perform very 
		different actions and are used under differing circumstances.
		<p>
		
		<h4>=</h4>
		<p>     The = is how we store a value inside of a variable, and it is used with all 
		data types. You use = when declaring, and defining a variable. For example, if we 
		would like to store a value of 5 inside of a variable we want to name x, we would 
		say “int x =5;”. </p>
		
		<h4>==</h4>
		<p>     The == is a boolean reference comparison, and it checks that both variables 
		point to the same object (memory location). For instance, if the variables x and y
		both have the value “5” stored, the comparison of (x == y) would evaluate to 
		“true”. In other words, it only compares the shallow values of the variable. You 
		can’t test if Strings are “the same” using ==. For example, the shallow value of 2 
		Strings are only equal when they refer to the same memory location. This is best 
		used when we want to evaluate that 2 variables both point to the same object, such 
		as 2 double variables both have stored a “5.0”. </p>
		
		<h4>.equals()</h4>
		<p>     This is used exclusively with String data types. This is used to see if the 
		values stored within String variables, or a variable to a String of text are 
		identical to each other. It compares the deep values of variables rather than the 
		shallow values. Strings don’t follow mathematical rules, so we cannot effectively 
		use operators such as == on them. As a replacement, we use this method to 
		determine that the Strings match up character for character exactly. If the String 
		within the variable matches up to the other string exactly, it evaluates to 
		“true”, if that is not the case the method evaluates to “false”.  An example use 
		case would be if we wanted to determine if a user’s input for their first name 
		like “Chris” matched an account with any record of first name that was already 
		stored. </p>
		
		<h4>In Conclusion</h4>
		<p>     As you can see each one of these tools uniquely satisfies users' needs
		for coding in Java. Even though they look similar, its imperative to analyze
		that you are using the correct one for your unique situation.</p>
